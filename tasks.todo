# Before launch

- Get testimonials (coworkers, employers, community)
- Research how to deploy (when https://stackdock.com's up) & write a rake task.
- Point DNS to botanicus.me.

# Later

- Link to my blog.
- Nginx: vhost conf ready for deployment, logs etc.
- When Docker supports unprivileged users, change from root.
